# Bezlio Apps
This is a repository for all of the open-source applications that run on top of the Bezlio platform.  In this repository you will find the Javascript code that is dynamically being utilized within these Bezls along with exported versions of the Bezls themselves should you need to modify them.  

## Primary Focus Roles

These are the roles we are actively focusing on currently:

* [Sales Manager](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-apps/tree/development/roles/sales-manager)

* [Sales Rep](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-apps/tree/development/roles/sales-rep)

The sales rep role should provide what most users would expect out of a CRM - the ability to easily pull up assigned accounts and related information, call logging, account task maintenance, RFQ entry, personal performance metrics, and pipeline.

## Additional Roles

In the long-term a great number of roles will be represented here.  We are not yet explicitly focusing on the development of these roles, but as we perform custom projects for users if they can fit into a cleanly-defined role we will place them out here:

* [Production Team Leader](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-recipes/tree/master/roles/production-team-leader)
