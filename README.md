The recipe book is organized by role but Bezls from here are intented to be mixed-and-matched to suite your needs:

## Roles - Existing / Currently Being Developed

* [Common](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-recipes/tree/master/roles/common)

Common would be our vision for what all users might have on their Home panel.  That would include a company calendar, task lists, company directory, and announcements.

* [CEO](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-recipes/tree/master/roles/ceo)

Monitor the overall health of an organization.  The vision for this role is to provide many visualizations to help boil the multitude of data points a CEO needs to see in order to monitor operations.  Visualizations would include projected cash flows, comparitive sales breakdowns, production throughput, inventory levels, sales pileline, etc.  This panel will largely be pulling together the visualizations that each other role may include.

* [CFO](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-recipes/tree/master/roles/cfo)

Monitor the financial health of an organization.  Tools here would be similar to what would be found on the CEO panel.

* [Customer Service](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-recipes/tree/master/roles/customer-service)

Front-line support in interacting with customers.  This role needs fast and efficient access to many types of data in order to answer customer questions.  They also need the tools to rapidly enter orders with as many hot keys and shortcuts as possible.

The sales rep role should provide what most users would expect out of a CRM - the ability to easily pull up assigned accounts and related information, call logging, account task maintenance, RFQ entry, personal performance metrics, and pipeline.


## Roles - Planned

* [Accounts Payable](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-recipes/tree/master/roles/accounts-payable)

Responsible for maintaining the payments to suppliers. The vision for this role would be a panel that would provide this individual with the tools to enter and review invoices submitted by suppliers as compared to the receipts of goods, visualize projected cash flows, and approve payments.

* [Accounts Receivable](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-recipes/tree/master/roles/accounts-receivable)

Responsible for collecting the payments from customers.  The vision for this role would be a panel to facilitate the mass generation of invoices, monitor collections, automate the process of sending collections follow-ups, and visualize inbound cash flows.

* [Engineering](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-recipes/tree/master/roles/engineering)

An engineer needs tools to help them to easily attribute their time to engineering tasks, keep track of assigned tasks, and associate drawings / other deliverables with jobs being sent to the floor.  They will also have tools to facilitate communications with production workers that may need assistance.

* [IT](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-recipes/tree/master/roles/it)

The IT role needs tools to keep track of user service requests, keep track of assigned hardware, and monitor servers and hardware.

* [IT Manager](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-recipes/tree/master/roles/it-manager)

The IT manager seeks more of a birds-eye view of the IT department, ensuring that service requests are being completed in a timely manner.  Visualizations should be presented in order to monitor IT expenses versus budget.  Tools to monitor and approve IT purchase requests.
