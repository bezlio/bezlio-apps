# Company Directory
This Bezl reads from a data source (by default C:\Program Files (x86)\Bezlio Remote Data Broker\Data\company-directory.xlsx) and presents into a grid.  This was generated using the standard advanced grid template with the simple addition of click to dial / click to e-mail for now.  Long term we will add additional functionality to this as requested by users.
